Audio Analysis Description:

1. Energy Variation:
   - Minimum Energy: 44.90
   - Maximum Energy: 1024.00
   - Mean Energy: 808.38
   - Description: The audio shows up-and-down variations in loudness corresponding to speech and quieter/noise segments.

2. RMS (Amplitude) Contour:
   - Minimum RMS: 0.5368
   - Maximum RMS: 1.0000
   - Mean RMS: 0.8844
   - Description: RMS contour indicates how amplitude changes over time, highlighting louder vs quieter sections of the audio.

3. Pitch Contour:
   - Minimum Pitch (Hz): 152.98
   - Maximum Pitch (Hz): 1694.49
   - Mean Pitch (Hz): 194.25
   - Description: Shows the fundamental frequency of voiced segments. Variations indicate natural speech intonation and emphasis.

4. Spectrogram / Frequency Content:
   - Description: The audio contains energy across multiple frequencies. Higher frequencies may indicate noise or sibilance, while concentrated mid frequencies correspond to speech. Variations over time reflect speech dynamics.

5. Estimated Noise Ratio:
   - Approximately 20.13% of frames are below the noise threshold (quieter segments likely containing background noise).
